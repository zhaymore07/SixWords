SixWords is a creative writing tool that seeks to spark imagination through the challenge of writing a story, a pitch, or a memoir in six words or less. SixWords puts a twist on the six-word novel by randomly selecting nouns, verbs, or a mood that should be incorporated into the story. SixWords was developed with the goal of helping those who have writers-block or are in a slump exercise their creative muscles through providing inspirartion to those who need a challenge.   

## Motivation
>The enemy of art is the absence of limitations.  
-Orson Welles

As Orson Welles states, creativity flows out of restrictions. I am creating SixWords due to my love for the six-word novel, and the creativity that can spring forth from its limitations. In a six-word novel, the writer is challenged to write a novel, story, or a memoir in just six words or less. From the limitation, the artist, designer, writer, or software engineer is challenged to provide a snippet of something that conveys the meaning of something larger, grand, or complex.   
  
I found that even though I love the six-word memoir it was sometimes difficult to know where to start, so to solve that problem, I have designed SixWords to be able to randomly select a noun, verb, or mood that must be included in the six word story, which provides a further limitation while also opening a vast realm of possibilities of what the story could convey.   
  
I intend for SixWords to not just be used by writers with writers-block, but I think SixWords caters to a vast array of audiences in need of inspiration and limitation-inspired creativity. Users can challenge themselves to write whatever they need in six words. A software developer could challenge themself to write six words on a potential feature for their software or website, using one of the randomly selected nouns, verbs, or moods.  
  
Overall, a love of creativity and endless possibilities in the face of limitations is what motivates this application. 

## Project Status
I am working on this project alone, as a personal-side project in-between classes at University. As of 12/15/2020, I have implemented and tested my first iteration of the model classes and I am currently developing the GUI using Java Swing.
