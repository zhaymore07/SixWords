# SixWords
SixWords is a desktop Java application that is utilized by the user to create/ write six-word memoirs from randomly selected nouns, verbs, or moods. The Memoirs are stored in text files and are tracked and loaded into the system by the date that they were created and/or their title.

## Motivation
>The enemy of art is the absence of limitations.  
-Orson Welles

As Orson Welles states, creativity flows out of restrictions. I am creating SixWords due to my love for the six-word novel, and the creativity that can spring forth from its limitations. In a six-word novel, the writer is challenged to write a novel, story, or a memoir in just six words or less. From the limitation, the artist, designer, writer, or software engineer is challenged to provide just a snippet of something that conveys the meaning of something larger, grand, or complex.   
  
I found that even though I love the six-word memoir it was sometimes difficult to start to think of what to write, so to solve that problem, I have designed SixWords to be able to randomly select a noun, verb, or mood that is generated that either must be included in the six word story or should at least inspire it, which provides a further limitation while also opening a vast realm of possibilities of what the story could convey.   
  
I intend for SixWords to not just be used by writers with writers-blocks, but I think SixWords caters to a vast array of audiences in need of inspiration and limitation-inspired creativity. Users can challenge themselves to write whatever they need in six words. A software developer could challenge themself to write six words on a potential feature for their software or website, using one of the randomly selected nouns, verbs, or moods.  
  
Overall, a love of creativity and endless possibilities in the face of limitations is what motivates this application. 

## Project Status
I am working on this project alone, as a personal-side project in-between classes at University, and as of November 11, 2020, I am just getting started designing and coding the project as a desktop application. I will update the README as I move further along in the process. So for now, there is no application to launch or load. My intention is to eventually make this a web application after I design the underlying function and model of the program.
